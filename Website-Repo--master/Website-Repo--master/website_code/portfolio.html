            I had the opportunity to work on a technical project as part of my software engineering internship with Lockheed Martin 
            that supported test-driven development. I developed automated test scripts using a GUI automation tool, Sikuli,  that used Python as it's scripting language.
            The biggest takeaways I learned from the project was learning how beneficial automated scripts can be in increasing efficiency, accuracy and traceability 
            of an application. Furthermore, because I was working on scripts that would be used in testing I was focused
            on reliability and accuracy in my code, through which I grew as a developer. I also participated in the Agile/Scrum Development Process while working on this project. I participated in Daily Standups, Retrospectives, PI planning, story creation,
            backlog refinement and other Agile ceremonies. <br><br>

            Welcome to my current project, I am presently working to create my digital professional thumb-print via the web as part of a TAMU 
            programming course, CSCE 315. The project has allowed me to become more familiar with using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Send me a note if you have any advice or feedback on how it looks and operates using the contact link in the top navigation bar. 
            You are looking at the most current product iteration of my website.

            Present: Buddy Allocator (TAMU Project - CSCE 313)

        <p>
            As part of an Operating Systems class I am currently taking at TAMU, I am creating a buddy allcoator. Often the OS functions
            that manage memory are too generic, and many programs have specific memory request patterns. Furthermore, many high-performance applications
            become bottlenecked. That is why many applications use their own memory manager to reduce load on the OS memory manager. This project is essentially creating
            a memory managing program using C++ to implement it. So far, the project has reenforced in my mind the importance of attempting not to waste memory.
