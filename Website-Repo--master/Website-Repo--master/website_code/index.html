                    A little bit about me.. <br><br>

                    My name is Emma Haeussler. I am from Fort Worth, Texas. 
                    I am a creative person. I have always enjoyed the arts, music, and literature; I like to use my creativity to solve
                    complex problems and to build connections that form larger pictures. It may come, then, as no surprise that I chose to study both
                    Math and Computing at Texas A&M, where I am currently a student. I have tremendously enjoyed studying both content areas, especially
                    getting to witness the myriad connections between the two. 
                    <br><br>
                    I hope to one day work as a software engineer and use my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems that ultimately help people. Some of my strengths that I believe would positively contribute to a software engineering team are that I am dedicated to the tasks I undertake and seek
                    excellence in all I do. With the tasks I undertake however, I seek improvement in how I undertake them, and not perfection, and extend that same grace towards others. 
                    I have strong communication skills to clearly be able to articulate the problems and solutions that I deal with to others, and I enjoy collaborating in teams to achieve our goals.
                    <br><br>
                    Some fun facts about me, I am a member of the Hullabaloo Pep Band at Texas A&M. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tamuhullabalooband/" style="color:black""><i class="fas fa-music"></i></a>(I play the euphonium.) We support
                    the volleyball, soccer, and basketball teams on campus. I also love Jesus, coffee, and learning new things.
