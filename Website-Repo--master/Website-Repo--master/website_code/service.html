            It is important to me that service always be an integral part of my life and work. Below are ways I have served my community
            in my time in college, and also where I hope to serve and give back once I graduate.
        </h2>
        <h2>Peer Help and Tutoring Program</h2>

            My freshmen year I was part of a Freshmen Leadership Organization called FREE (Freshmen Reaching Excellence in Engineering) <a href="https://www.freefreshmen.com/" style="color:#000000"><i class="fas fa-users-cog"></i></a>
            <br>In that organization, I had mentors who helped me to acclimate to college life, develop good study habits, and who were able to give
            advice and encouragement in my academic journey. When I became a sophomore, I wanted to give back to that organization, FREE, by becoming a mentor myself. 
            The picture above is a group of the freshmen that I mentored in their first year within Engineering.

        <h2>Grace Bible Church Volunteer</h2>
        <img src="dt.jpg" alt="Dream Team" class="center" width=40%>
        <p>
            Since my sophomore year, I have volunteered with my church, Grace Bible Church. <a href="https://www.grace-bible.org/" style="color:#000000;"><i class="fas fa-church"></i></a>
            On Sunday mornings,  we helped to efficiently set-up and tear-down for church as well as greeted the students as they came in. 
        </p>
        <h2>Hope for Future Service: STEM Education</h2>
        <img src="stem.jpg" alt="STEM" class="center" width=40%>
        <p>
            Throughout college, I worked as a tutor for the University <a href="https://studyhub.tamu.edu/" style="color:#000000;""><i class="fas fa-school"></i></a>
            where I helped students to gain understanding in their STEM classes such as Calculus, Physics,
            and Computer Science. I saw that there can such impact in empowering a student to have the necessary tools and knowledge to succeed in whatever they choose to. Once I graduate, I hope to continue mentoring and tutoring students in some way to encourage them in their learning journey. I believe engaging students' curiosity and 
            giving them a drive for learning can truly change the world.
